# ObjectOriented-Ex1
Complex Function - Assigment 1 in Object Oriented - java - Second academic year - Ariel University


In this project we will present some classes of mathematical functions.
Also, in each class there are several methods that characterize the operations that can be performed on any mathematical function and display them in a graphical window.
In addition, we will present four test classes that examine the correctness of each method in each class.
The main motivation of this project is to enable the user to use each function correctly and easily to operate with the goal of being used by more programmers around the world.
